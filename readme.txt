**Smooth Scrolling To Element**
Smooth Scrolling effect where you click on a link and your browser smoothly scrolls down to the appropriate section. This can be achived by a shortcode and can be used multiple time on a page.

<code>[ss_link link="content1" name="Click Me" class="button"]</code>

Where [ss_link] is the main shortcode and all other are parameters. 

**Go To Top**
For websites that have a lot of information on the page you will scroll far down the page to consume the information. Websites with initiate scroll need something to make it easy to return to the top. 
This is done with a button which will scroll them back to the top.
